Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it

Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development

reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

=&gt; Some SVs are significantly associated with Sample Conditions and
Patient Tumor Recurrence (interesting variance). It may be that
Condition accounts for major variance in data, so some associations with
constructed SVs are inevitable. For Recurrence, it may be due to
outliler samples observed in molecular signatures, especially of Normal
samples (check Section Normal samples - UNADJUSTED). Those outlier
samples are mostly from Recurrence patient groups, and SVA tries to
estimate differences between outlier and the other samples
(uninteresting variance), which makes those SVs associated with
Recurrence.</p>

=&gt; There are some samples with much higher or lower abundances
(middle) or relatively higher or lower abundances (right), which can
increase effect size, giving rise to significant results. However, those
significant features may be false positives. It explains why sample
clustering looks bad and why much less significant features are
identified with adjusted data. That those samples with distinct
behaviors are due to biological or technical factors can be further
investigated.</p>
