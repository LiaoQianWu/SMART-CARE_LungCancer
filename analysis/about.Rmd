This Method Development cohort is defined by 20 Lung Cancer patients. At the Baseline
timepoint (during the surgical treatment), Tumor and Normal Tissue samples were
taken from the patients. In addition, Plasma samples were also taken, so-called
Baseline Plasma. After two years, Plasma samples were taken again from these 20
patients where half of them suffered cancer recurrences.\

With the Tumor and Normal Tissue samples and Baseline and Follow-up Plasma samples,
Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Lipidomics was generated by different research team
using varied methods. The data we currently obtain includes:\
Targeted Tissue and Plasma Metabolomics from AG Hell,\
DDA Tissue and Plasma Proteomics from AG Krijgsveld, and\
Untargeted Tissue and Plasma Metabolomics and Lipidomics from AG Hopf, 8 datasets
in total.
