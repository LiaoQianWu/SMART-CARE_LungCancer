This Method Development cohort is defined by 20 Lung Cancer patients. At the Baseline
timepoint (during the surgical treatment), Tumor and Normal Tissue samples were
taken from the patients. In addition, Plasma samples were also taken, so-called
Baseline Plasma. After two years, Plasma samples were taken again from these 20
patients where half of them suffered cancer recurrences. With these samples, Proteomics,
Metabolomics, and Lipidomics was generated by different research team using varied
methods.\

We currently got 12 datasets as follows:\
AG Hell &rarr; Targeted Tissue and Plasma Metabolomics (2)\
AG Krijgsveld &rarr; DDA and DIA Tissue and Plasma Proteomics (5)\
AG Hopf &rarr; Untargeted Tissue and Plasma Metabolomics and Lipidomics (4)\
AG Klingmüller &rarr; DIA Tissue Proteomics (1)

The preprocessed datasets can be downloaded from openBIS (/COMPUTATIONAL_SPACE/LU/LU_DATA_1/THRX_DATA_ALL),
and the preprocessing details can be found in Section 1: Data Preprocessing.

### 1. Data Preprocessing
We first preprocessed all datasets stated above, which includes data cleansing and
data normalization using VSN. For Untargeted Metabolomics and Lipidomics generated
by AG Hopf, due to triplicate measures of each sample, we also (1) compared varied
data normalization techniques (log2-transformation, VSN, and median normalization),
(2) conducted batch correction if needed, and (3) merged triplicates into individual measures.

### 2. Preliminary (Single-Omics) Analysis
We conducted univariate (association test) and multivariate (PCA) analyses on every
single dataset to take an initial look at the power of each dataset in terms of
predicting patient cancer recurrences. Association tests between features (e.g.,
metabolite levels) and cancer recurrence were systematically performed to capture
recurrence-related features, and PCA was performed to see if there exists any
recurrence-related PC. The results show that Plasma samples can potentially
provide more recurrence-related information from Metabolomics and Lipidomics than
Tissue samples, which also indicates that Tissue samples are more noisy.

### 3. Comparisons Between Datasets Generated by Different Methods
We investigated the similarity between Targeted and Untargeted Plasma/Tissue Metabolomics
generated by AG Hell and AG Hopf, respectively. The results reveal that Targeted
and Untargeted Plasma/Tissue metabolite features are not that correlated, which
may indicate that either they can provide complementary information or there exists
technical or biological noise.

### 4. MOFA Models
We trained several MOFA models on varied omics data combinations to observe the
model performance on predicting patient cancer recurrences. The idea is that, in
clinical situations, Plasma samples are easier to collect, so we firstly built
models using only Plasma omics (Plasma Metabolomics, Lipidomics, and Proteomics),
and based on these models, we then added or removed omics to see changes in the
model performance.

### 4.2 [Enrichment Analysis](mofa_downstream_analysis.html)

### 4.3 [Old: Trained MOFA Models](mofa_varied_omics_combinations.html)
The results show that, in general, the model trained on the combination composed
of Untargeted Plasma Metabolomics, Plasma Lipidomics, and Plasma Proteomics performs best.
