<br/>
Some findings:\
a. Plasma samples can potentially provide more recurrence-related information and
Tissue samples seem to be more noisy.\
---> Please check more details in the 'Summary' section of the preliminary analysis.\
<br/>
b. The similarity between Targeted and Untargeted Plasma and Tissue Metabolomics
is not that high.\
---> Please check more details in the 'Comparisons Between Targeted and Untargeted
Metabolomics' report.\
<br/>
c. Generally, the MOFA model trained on the omics data combination composed of
Untargeted Plasma Metabolomics, Plasma Lipidomics, and Plasma Proteomics performs
best in terms of predicting patient cancer recurrences.\
---> Please check more details in the 'MOFA Models Trained on Varied Combinations
of Omics Data' report.\
